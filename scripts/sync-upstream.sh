#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Merge upstream code improvements into this fork and push, keeping the fork's
# own scraped data and personal config.
#
# Used by .github/workflows/sync_upstream.yml, and safe to run by hand from a
# clone of your fork (e.g. to unstick a failed sync):
#
#   bash scripts/sync-upstream.sh
#
# What it does:
#   - git merge upstream/main -X ours: code merges in; content conflicts keep
#     this fork's side.
#   - output/ is reset to exactly this fork's tree. Scraped data is per-repo,
#     so upstream's demo data never leaks in — including one-sided upstream
#     edits and modify/delete conflicts, which neither -X ours nor merge=ours
#     handle.
#   - This script and sync_upstream.yml also stay exactly as this fork has
#     them, so an upstream edit can never break future syncs.
#   - config.json / scoring_profile.json, if this fork tracks them, are restored
#     from a pre-merge backup. Untracked copies are left alone.
#   - Any remaining conflict outside output/ is a real code conflict: the
#     script stops without committing or pushing.
#   - If the merge leaves names undefined in a .py file (upstream changed code
#     this fork customized, and -X ours mixed the two), it also stops. Needs
#     pyflakes; skipped with a warning if it isn't installed.
#
# Why merge and not rebase: upstream once tracked and later deleted
# config.json. A rebase replays that delete and wipes the fork's config.
#
# Environment:
#   UPSTREAM_URL  overrides where to sync from (URL or local path)
#
# Where to sync from, in order: UPSTREAM_URL; config.json's
# sync.upstream_repo ("owner/repo", a URL, or a path); otherwise
# sahiltalwar88/job-scraper, the repo job-hunter users fork. The maintainer's
# own fork sets sync.upstream_repo to ScottCoffin/Job_Scraper.
